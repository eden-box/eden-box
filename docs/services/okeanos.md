[Okeanos](https://okeanos.grnet.gr/home/) and [Okeanos-Global](https://okeanos-global.grnet.gr/home/) guide.

## Description
Okeanos is GRNET's cloud service for the Greek Research and Academic Community. Okeanos-Global was launched, supported by the European Union, in order to provide cloud resources to other academic communities across the globe, including Portugal. If one has access to an affiliated educational institution account, he is then able to use these resources. The available resources include 2 virtual machines, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, a VPN network, cloud storage and other related management utilities. For this project, only Okeanos-Global resources are currently used.

## Pithos
File Storage service accessible through Okeanos Global website interface and able to host several files.
Currently, all virtual machine's snapshots are saved on this platform and shared with a private group named 'eden-box', to which other users related to the project can be added. 

## Cyclades
Virtual Compute and Network service to build and manage virtual machines from within a web browser.
Used when machines need to be redeployed from a snapshot or remotely restarted.
Basic usage metrics are accessible in order to easily detect abnormal execution.

## Access
One can access the resources through the academic [login](https://accounts.okeanos-global.grnet.gr/ui/login).
Currently, the only shareable resources are the snapshots, as machines are bound to the account of the user who created them.
