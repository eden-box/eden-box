## Description
Okeanos is GRNET's cloud service, for the Greek Research and Academic Community. Some time after starting this project, and given the EUropen union support, Okeanos-Global was launched, providing cloud resources to other academic communities across the globe, which includes Portugal. If one has access to an affiliated institution universitary account, he is then able to use these resources. The available resources include 2 VM machines, Ipv4 and Ipv6 addresses, a VPN network and cloud storage.
