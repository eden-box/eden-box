Eden Box Project

## Description
The Eden Box project comprises an online File Server where several academical information and content is publicly provided, free of charge.
The number of accesses to files, and correspondent timestamp, are gathered and saved in a database in order to better discern which contents are more frequently viewed and therefore useful,
providing metrics for further development and honing of the service.

Our intent focuses on delivering a reliable way of obtaining academic study materials while suppressing the need to waste time looking for them, which could be better allocated to honest research and knowledge acquisition.
