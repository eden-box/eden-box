Eden Box Project

## Description
The Eden Box project comprises an online File Server where several academical information and content is provided to the public, free of charge.
The number of accesses to files, and correspondant timestamp, is gathered and saved in a Database as to better discern which contents are more frequently accessed and therefore usefull,
providing metrics for further development and honing of the service.

Our intent is to provide reliable access to academic materials while supressing the need to waste limited study time looking for them, which could be better allocated to honest research and knowledge acquisition.
